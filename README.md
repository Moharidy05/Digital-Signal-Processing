# Signal Processing Framework 📈

This repository contains a simple, menu-driven Python framework for loading, visualizing, and performing basic arithmetic operations on one-dimensional signal data. It leverages **NumPy** for efficient numerical handling and **Matplotlib** for comprehensive plotting.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Data Loading:** Load signal data (index and amplitude pairs) from a plain text file.
* **Visualization:** Display a signal simultaneously in **continuous** (line plot) and **discrete** (stem plot) representations.
* **Comparison:** Plot two signals together to visually compare them.
* **Arithmetic Operations:**
    * **Addition:** Add two or more signals together (supports signals of different lengths via zero-padding).
    * **Multiplication:** Amplify, reduce, or invert a signal by multiplying it by a constant factor.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this framework, you'll need Python installed, along with the following libraries:

1.  **NumPy**
2.  **Matplotlib**

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
